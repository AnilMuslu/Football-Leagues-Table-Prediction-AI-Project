# Football Leagues Table Prediction AI Project
AI project to predict european 5 big football leagues table using MLP classifier and Random Forest algorithm

This project is an artificial intelligence project that predicts the final point standings of the top 5 football leagues in Europe for the 2020 season, using data from the 2015-2019 seasons of those leagues. The project is developed using Python programming language in Jupyter Notebook.

## About the Project

This artificial intelligence project analyzes the past performance data of football teams to predict the league standings at the end of the 2020 season. The data is obtained from the top five football leagues in Europe (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1) between 2015 and 2019. The project utilizes machine learning and data analysis techniques to make predictions based on this data.
